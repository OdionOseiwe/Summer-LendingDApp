# Summer LendingDApp


Summer LendingDApp, a decentralized application, enables users to secure USDC loans using various collateral assets, featuring a liqudation factor set at 90%, which is 10% higher than the collateral factor. The collateral asset's price is determined using the Chainlink price oracle. The Dapp incorporates a minimum borrow amount to safeguard against potential fund losses. Moreover, Summer LendingDApp offers user incentives to promote its usage.

Notably, Summer LendingDApp adopts the CompoundV3 minimum borrowing requirement and limits borrowing to a single asset while providing additional incentives to users. It's worth mentioning that the liquidation method employed by Summer LendingDApp differs from that of CompoundV3.
